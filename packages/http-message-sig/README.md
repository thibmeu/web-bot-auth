| Explicit verification policy               | Required                                                  |
| WebCrypto providers                        | Ed25519 and RSA-PSS with SHA-512                          |

## Signing

```typescript
import { appendSignature, createSignature } from "http-message-sig";

const fields = await createSignature(request, {
  label: "sig1",
  components: ["@method", "@authority", "@path", "content-digest"],
  parameters: { created: 1_700_000_000, alg: signer.algorithm, keyid: "key-1" },
  signer,
});

const headers = appendSignature(request.headers, fields);
```

Signers consume UTF-8 signature-base bytes and expose `readonly algorithm`.
`appendSignature` accepts `Headers` only, returns a clone, and atomically parses
and merges both signature dictionaries.

Use `component("example-dict", { key: "member" })` for parameterized
components. `componentIdentity` returns the exact serialized component
identifier.

Descriptors can provide `Uint8Array` field values for `bs` and
`structuredType: "item" | "list" | "dictionary"` for `sf`. Fetch objects
cannot expose raw field occurrences, raw bytes, or trailers.

## Verification

```typescript
import { verifySignature } from "http-message-sig";

const verified = await verifySignature(request, {
  policy: {
    algorithms: ["ed25519"],
    requiredComponents: ["@method", "@authority", "@path"],
    requiredParameters: ["created", "keyid"],
    maxAge: 300,
    clockSkew: 5,
  },
  resolveVerifier(untrustedCandidate, context) {
    return lookupVerifier(untrustedCandidate.parameters.keyid, context);
  },
});
```

The resolver candidate is untrusted until cryptographic verification succeeds.
The optional policy `validate` callback receives authenticated data and runs
only after successful cryptographic verification.

## Limitations

- Unknown derived components and extension component parameters are rejected
  with `UnsupportedFeature`.
- RFC 9651 dates and display strings are rejected. Signature metadata and
  covered Structured Fields are limited to RFC 8941 values.
- Fetch does not expose raw field occurrences or trailers. Use descriptors when
  those values matter.
- `Response` has no related request. Use a response descriptor for `req`.
- Cryptographic algorithms and key discovery are supplied by the caller.
- The former directory helpers and draft-era `signatureHeaders`, `verify`, and
  `RequestLike` APIs were removed. Directory behavior belongs in the consuming
  package and must migrate to `createSignature` plus `appendSignature`.

## Errors

Library validation failures use `SignatureError`, stable `SignatureErrorCode`
values, and `isSignatureError`.

## Security

This software has not been audited. Applications must define policy appropriate
to their protocol, including algorithm, component, parameter, and freshness
requirements.
